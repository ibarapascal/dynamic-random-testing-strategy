# Dynamic random testing strategy

The py code of my graduation thesis about the simulation/analysis of __dynamic random testing strategy__

Written in around May 2018.

Generated some charts.

I thought I've lost it since the laptop I used has gone years ago.  

Luckily I found the code right exists inside the article placed in the appendix.

Feel free to request if you want to read the article (written in Chinese though).

Just for memory.
